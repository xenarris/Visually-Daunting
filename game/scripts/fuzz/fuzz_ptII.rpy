# February 23 â€” National Banana Bread Day

# Characters go through steps of making banana bread
# Miss jealous is going to keep offering steps (suggestions)
# As Miss Perfect dominates the screen - smiling/doing/being flawless
# But then when Miss Perfect asks Miss Jealous for the next step
# Miss Jealous won't remember
#And that will set her off.

# never given names because caught in the middle of stream

# So we're going to mix in the ___ just like that

# While you mash up those

# And our next step is...

# Looks at Miss Jealous

# Pauses

# Miss Jealous - (maybe - I'm sorry...I don't know.) I can't remember.

# Miss Perfect bigger smile, swaps right back to camera

# Adding the egg!  (Something stupid silly easy to remember here.  Figure it out)

# Oh. Yeah.  The egg.

# We're going to mix this x-mins

# Then place it in...cut off by miss jealous.
