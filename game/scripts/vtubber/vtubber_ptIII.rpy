# Now as for you [carepare highlighted]

# What will you do for me?

# Sacrifice your ____?

# Kill your parents?

# Like this lovely follower did

# Or maybe you would prefer

# The blood to come from your own hand?

# A sacrifice must be made

# It's time you give in.

# I'm not sure how you've lasted this long, but you're surely an interesting...human being

# Are you scared?

# Are you confused?

# It's a simple concept.  Here let me show you.

# I've got this knife right here.

# And off

# goes

# the 

# hand

# See. Simple!

# Chat uproar

# Still nothing?

# Alright here.

# Cuts head off

# Head next to hand, shoulders empty

# You see, no pain.  Don't worry!

# Let's remove our fascades.

# Demon body appears

# Refuses parts

# And all that chatter

# Chat shifts to single cult chant fiant tenebrae!

# Yes.  That's better.  Now I can hear you, and you alone.

# So, my child.  Consider joining the darkness.

# The light provides nothing but endless wanting
